In this application, you will be able to load any current weather and weather forecast for a city of your choice.  Each city will also store to your computer history for quick picks up to 8 cities and load your most recent visit automatically upon visit.  

**Side note:  The UV api server appears to be down as of 11/16/2019 as it is giving me a 504(Gateway time-out) error.  Was working earlier in the day and I know that a server api connection problem due to bad key or url would be 404. The HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) 504 Gateway Timeout server error response code indicates that the server, while acting as a gateway or proxy, did not get a response in time from the upstream server that it needed in order to complete the request. A Gateway might refer to different things in networking and a 504 error is usually not something you can fix, but requires a fix by the web server or the proxies you are trying to get access through

note from documentation: If API call is succefull - 200 HTTP-code is returned. If location is not found or wrong APPID is specified then HTTP-code 404 or HTTP-code 400 are returned accordingly.

** Also, because api documentation did not provide weather codes for every possible catagory, I was not able to get an image for all weather types, however, majority of the 90% are there.
