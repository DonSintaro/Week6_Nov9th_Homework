# Week6_Nov9th_Homework


In this application, you will be able to load any current weather and weather forecast for a city of your choice.  Each city will also store to your computer history for quick picks up to 8 cities and load your most recent visit automatically upon visit.  

Completed requested fixes, the app now uses city id's for history button instead of names as that had caused the buttons to potential store a different city that what was originally viewed.
